Atlas is software that can indicate if there has been fraudulent activity on a database of bank accounts. Atlas has the ability to analyse transaction patterns and determine if activities are abnormal, based on a labelled dataset. This activity can be online spending, ATM withdrawals or in-store purchases. If Atlas finds any abnormal patterns then it will flag the transaction as suspicious. Atlas uses Machine Learning algorithms through Python to help us identify abnormal or unusual transactions.
